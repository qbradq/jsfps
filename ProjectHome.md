# What Is It? #

This is yet another tech demo, this time using the Canvas tag to create a First Person Shooter. As I actually play and enjoy FPS games I might actually find the interest to make a game out of this.

# Status #
Right now I have a basic "Wolfenstein 3D"-style demo with support for walls, floors, ceilings and object models. Player movement and collision detection are also supported. There are also a number of different graphical and input options you can adjust to suit your computer.

# What I am Working On #
Right now I am working on AI. I've been dreading this from the moment I started this project, but it's actually going quite well.

I also attempted to port the application to WebGL to see if that would help speed things up on my poor little net book. Short answer: no. Long answer: you pretty much need an AMD or nVidia graphics chip to even run WebGL as it relies on OpenGL 2.0. Now that I know this, I am practically salivating for the day that WebGL becomes more wide spread :D

# Future Plans #
This project will _never_ support textures. It's just not very feasible with the methods I am using. The only way it could happen would be to port the whole thing to WebGL. I am not targeting WebGL just because it is not wide spread enough.

I may add real-time dynamic lighting. We'll see :D

I want to implement ~~shooting~~, ~~hitting~~ and ~~killing~~ enemies, and enemy AI. After that it's pretty much down hill to make a game.
